    <h1> How does Microbe #705 interact with hornworms?</h1>

    <h2> Hypothesis </h2>
    <p class = "sleek"> <strong> Hornworms do not interact with Microbe #705 </strong> </p>

    <h2> Methods </h2>

    <p class = "sleek">
    The fungi was placed in the same dish as a hornworm to document the interaction
    between both. The dish had food for the hornworm as well. The <em> Rhizoctonia solani </em> (Microbe #705)
    was put in the dish without its agar. After one week, results were taken, and changes were made.
    The dish was then sealed with perafilm, and the fungus sample was replaced with one that had agar with it.
    After the second week, results were taken again.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Control: </strong> A petri dish with <em> Rhizoctonia solani </em> in PDA served as a control for this
                                experiment to compare it the sample with the hornworm.

    </p>

    <h2> Results </h2>

  <p class = "sleek">

    After one week, the hornworm was found living, with little food left. The fungus did not grow. After the second
    week, the hornworm was dead, and the fungus grew slightly (around 2 mm growth) with the little agar it had.
  </p>


  <h2> Conclusion </h2>

  <p class = "sleek">
    These results support the experimentâ€™s hypothesis. The hornworm did not find the fungus as a food source
    and did not interact with it much. Also, the fungus could not grow without the agar, but it grew a little
    after it was provided with agar. This experiment shows that the fungus needs nutrition from the agar to
    survive, and that it doesn't interact with hornworms. This means we might need to move from its
    interactions with animals to its interactions with plants to find more information on it. This is
    the basis of the fourth experiment.
