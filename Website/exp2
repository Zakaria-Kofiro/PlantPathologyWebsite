    <h1> How does Microbe #705 interact with Microbe #206?  </em></h1>

    <h2> Hypothesis </h2>
    <p class = "sleek"> <strong> <em> Rhizoctonia solani</em>’s (Microbe #705) growth is effected by Microbe #206. </strong> </p>

    <h2> Methods </h2>

    <p class = "sleek">
     Six treatments were set up, two treatments containing #705 with #206 in a PDA agar, another two containing only #705
     in a PDA agar, and two final treatments containing only #206 in PDA agar. The treatments containing only one microbe
     severed as controls. All treatments were left for two weeks to grow on a cabinet.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Control: </strong> #705 in PDA agar and #206 in PDA agar treatments served as controls for this experiment, because
                                the two were put together in a PDA petri dish. I had to make sure to compare how they usually
                                grow in PDA on their own to how they grow in PDA agar together, in order to avoid any
                                unwanted third variables.

  <p class = "sleek">

    In the agars that contained both microbes, the growth of <em> Rhizoctonia solani</em>'s growth (#706) was inhibited by the #206.
    There are visible lines where the growth of #206 takes over the growth of #705. Meanwhile, #705 grew a little
    above 40 mm in PDA, and #206 did not grow much in PDA.
  </p>


  <h2> Conclusion </h2>

  <p class = "sleek">
    These results support the experiment’s hypothesis. Microbe #206 does affect the growth of <em> Rhizoctonia Solani</em>,
    but because both microbes were grown in the PDA petri dishes, the Microbe #206 couldn’t grow as much.
     <em> Rhizoctonia Solani</em>'s growth was slightly affected by #206. From the results, it can also be seen that #206 grows better
    in NA instead of PDA. After doing some research, it seemed clear as to why microbe #206 affected #705. This is
    because #206 was <em> Bacillus mycoides</em>, which is known to inhibt the growth of fungi. This provided
    confirmation that this microbe was indeed a fungus.
