    <h1> How does Microbe #705 interact with pea seed germination? </h1>

    <h2> Hypothesis </h2>
    <p class = "sleek"> <strong> Microbe #705 will cause root rot and stop the seeds from germinating. </strong> </p>

    <h2> Methods </h2>

    <p class = "sleek">

    A sample of Microbe #705 was placed in a pot of soil along with pea seeds. The pot was watered and placed in light to grow.
    My control was a pot of soil without the microbe, which was also watered and placed in light. Both pots are left
    to grow for a week.

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Control: </strong> The control was a pot of soil growing pea seeds without the fungus because it is needed
                                 to the compare to the treatment. The pot will exhibit pea seed germination and growth
                                 without the microbe acting on, keeping other variables constant.

    After one week of growth, both pots did not have any signs of plant growth. After the second week,
    the control pot had a small pea plant growing, while the other pot with the microbe did not.
  </p>


  <h2> Conclusion </h2>

  <p class = "sleek">
    These results support the experimentâ€™s hypothesis. After two weeks,
    the pot with the microbe did not grow the plant. This means that something
    went wrong during germination. I had my suspicions that since my microbe
    is most likely <em> Rhizoctonia solani</em>, it would cause root rot. This
    experiment proved this to me, since it inhibited the growth of the pea plant.
