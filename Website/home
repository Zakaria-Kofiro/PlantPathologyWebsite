    <h1>Pet Report: #705 </h1>


    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class = "clean"> <strong> Brief Description: </strong> Pet microbe #705 is <em> Rhizoctonia solani </em>. It is a fungal pathogen
         that exists worldwide and has a great diversity of host plants. It is considered a soil-bourne pathogen, and is the cause of
        common plant diseases such as root rot and damping off. The pathogen usually attacks its host during its early
        growing stage, such as when its still a seed or seedling. Since its a soil-bourne pathogen, this makes sense, because
        seeds and seedlings are found in the soil.

        <br>
        <strong> Macroscopic: </strong> The fungus grows brown sclerotia, which are compact mass of hardened fungal
        mycelium, as it develops. When grown in an petri dish, the fungus has a brown, fuzzy appearance. The color of the
        fungus changes from light brown to a more darker brown as it grows, with it being darker closer to the center of growth.
        Hyphae branches can be seen at the edges of growth, given the fungus has not taken up the entire dish already.
        The fungus grows radially.

        <strong> Microscopic: </strong> When viewed under a microscope, the hyphae of the fungus can be seen branching out like tree branches.
                 The hyphae tend to branch off in right angles and have a slight constriction.

    <h2>Experiments</h2>

    <div class = "clean">

    <p class = "list"> Several experiments were conducted to find out more about pet microbe #705. Each experiment revealed
        some information about the given microbe. They included experiments on how #705 reacted to tempature change,
        along with its interactions with other microbes and living organisms. Data gathered from these
        experiments allowed me to determine what type of microbe it was.
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>A total of 4 experiments were conducted:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href='exp1'>Experiment 1</a></strong>: The effect of temperature on Microbe #705.</li>
      <li><strong><a href='exp2'>Experiment 2</a></strong>: How does Microbe #705 interact with Microbe #206?  </li>
      <li><strong><a href='exp3'>Experiment 3</a></strong>: How does Microbe #705 interact with a hornworms?</li>
      <li><strong><a href='exp4'>Experiment 4</a></strong>: How does Microbe #705 interact with pea seed germination? </li>
    </ul>
