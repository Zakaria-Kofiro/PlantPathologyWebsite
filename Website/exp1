    <h1> The effect of temperature on Microbe #705 </h1>

    <h2> Hypothesis </h2>
    <p class = "sleek"> <strong> The growth of <em> Rhizoctonia solani </em> (Microbe #705) is affected by temperature. </strong> </p>

    <h2> Methods </h2>

    <p class = "sleek">
    Three treatments of the fungus were set up in PDA agar. One petri dish was placed in a cabinet (room temperature, 23 C),
    one petri dish was kept in the fridge (colder temperature, below 23 C), and one petri dish was left in an incubator
    (hotter temperature, above 23 C). The petri dishes were left for 2 weeks. The cabinet petri dish was the control.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Control: </strong>The cabinet petri dish was the control because the original culture of #705 was grown in room tempature.
    Thus, the control was grown in the same enivorment and compared with the other samples that
    were subjected to different tempatures.

  <p class = "sleek">

    After one week of growth, the petri dishes that were kept in the warm and hotter environments grew
    to above 35 mm each, while the sample kept in the fridge did not grow at all. After two weeks, all
    petri dishes except the one kept in the fridge grew to the limit, taking up the entire dish. The
    one kept in the fridge did not grow at all.
  </p>


  <h2> Conclusion </h2>

  <p class = "sleek">
    These results support the experimentâ€™s hypothesis. After two weeks,
    the fungi samples that were kept in the cabinet and incubator had more growth than the one kept in the refrigerator (it did not grow at all).
    Thus, it is clear that temperature affects the growth of this fungi. For this particular fungus, cold temperatures
    inhibit its growth, suggesting it grows in environments that are not cold, at least not as cold as the ones
    kept in the lab refrigerator. <em> Rhizoctonia solani </em> grows in room temperatures and temperatures a little above room temperature,
    but not in colder temperatures. In an agricultural context, this might mean that plants that are susceptible to
    disease from this fungus can be grown in colder temperatures, as long as the plant can also survive in those temperatures.
